    "This notebook shows the word occurrences of the words involved in the tests (embedding quality and WEAT) across the three corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we will also determine the words to use for the WEAT tests. This is needed in order to avoid variability on the WEAT test due to a different number of words between the two target sets and between the two attribute sets (also between corpora). In particular, given the two target word sets X and Y, and the two attribute words sets A and B, we should ensure that X and Y have the same number of words, as well as for the sets A and B. We can encounter this problem when one or more test words are missing from one of the corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent this, we ensure to rely on the same sets of target and attribute words across the three corpora. The procedure is the following:\n",
    "1. compute the fraction of occurrence of each word across the three corpora, separately for each WEAT word set\n",
    "\n",
    "2. if some words are missing from at least one corpus, we need to remove the same amount of words on the other corresponding set. This is done by removing the rarest word/words. We assign to each word the minimum of the relative frequencies we measure across the three corpora, and the word/words with the least frequencies are the candidates to be discarded."
