    "This notebook will (1) generate the traing corpora and (2) count the number of occurrences of the words used for the tests in the corpus. The tests are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- training monitor tests: here we have words with upper and lower cases, and possible inflection of words (e.g., in toefl and syn-sem tests we have also plural words, past tenses..)\n",
    "\n",
    "- WEAT test: here all the words corresponds to their lemmas (all lower cased)\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the two sets of words are different. To count the occurrences of the words of each set, I will build each time two corpora: one keeping the words in their original inflection (used for training monitor tests) and the other lemmatizing all the words (for WEAT test). Counts are computed for each decade and finally aggregated to assess both occurrences per decade and in the whole corpus.\n",
